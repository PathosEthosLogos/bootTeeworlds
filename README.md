# bootTeeworlds
This automatically starts Teeworlds services when the server is shutdown and restarted


The reason why I created this is because auto starting Teeworlds server instance in Ubuntu on boot as a non-root is horribly complicated.
This auto starting requires "systemd" so make sure it's installed on your machine.
