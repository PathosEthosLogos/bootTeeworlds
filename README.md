# bootTeeworlds
This automatically starts Teeworlds server as non-root when the Ubuntu server is shutdown and restarted using systemd


The reason why I created this is because auto starting Teeworlds server instance in Ubuntu on boot as a non-root is horribly complicated.
This auto starting requires "systemd" so make sure it's installed on your machine.
The reason why it needs to be non-root is because as root, the demo files recorded by the servers are stored in unintuitive places.
